 <!-- Structural isomorphism in the context of Data Object Model (DOM) refers to the concept that different data structures can have the same shape or structure, even if they contain different data. This means that two structures are considered structurally isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their components and the connections (or relationships) between those components.

 
 In more technical terms, structural isomorphism is about the correspondence between the nodes and edges of two graphs (or tree structures in the case of DOM) that preserves the structure. Here's how this can be understood in different contexts: -->
